# SIRU-Model
SIRU-Model developed for Simulation and Visualization Course Exam

In this notebook, we will use the model developed in the paper written by P. Magal and G. Webb with the title Predicting the number of reported and unreported cases for the COVID-19 epidemic in South Korea, Italy, France and Germany. If you are interested in the paper, you can reach it from [here](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.21.20040154v1.full.pdf). 

Data used in the notebook retrieved from [WHO](https://covid19.who.int).

The notebook is not complete and there are some shortcomings such as problems in implementing the \(\tau(t)\) function into the _odeint_ function from _scipy.integrate_ package.
